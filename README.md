# Automated Trading Bot - Setup Guide

## Overview

This automated trading bot connects to Zerodha's trading platform and provides notifications via Telegram. The bot requires several environment variables to be set up before it can run properly.

## Inspiration

Most of the strategies are based on the guidance of our trading Guruji, **Mahesh Sir**, and some strategies have been created by me.

## Prerequisites

- GitHub account
- Zerodha trading account credentials
- Telegram bot token and user ID
- Google Service Account credentials (if using Google drive integration for log files)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Variables Configuration

Add these secrets to your GitHub repository:

1. Go to your repository's **Settings** > **Secrets and variables** > **Actions**
2. Click **New repository secret** for each required variable:

#### Required Secrets

| Secret Name                     | Description                                                                   |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`            | Obtain from Telegram's @BotFather bot                                         |
| `TELEGRAM_USER_ID`              | Get from @userinfobot on Telegram                                             |
| `ZERODHA_USER_ID`               | Your Zerodha Kite login ID                                                    |
| `ZERODHA_USER_PASSWORD`         | Your Zerodha Kite login password                                              |
| `ZERODHA_TPIN_TOKEN`            | Zerodha two-factor authentication token                                       |
| `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_BASE64` | Base64 encoded Google Service Account JSON(service_account_encoder.py --help) |

### 2. Automation Setup

Once all secrets are configured:

1. The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically use these environment variables
2. The bot will run according to the schedule defined in `.github/workflows/`
3. You'll receive status notifications via Telegram

### How to stop some strategies  
goto .github\workflows\[open your strategy file that you want to stop]  
here are similar schedule codes in each file you have to simply add # before the cron (word)  
for example this will run 
```on:
  schedule:
    # Single trigger at 8:00 AM IST (2:30 AM UTC)
    - cron: '30 0 1 * 1-5'  # Runs Mon-Fri at 8:00 AM IST
  workflow_dispatch:  # Manual trigger for both buy and sell
```  
this will not run becouse we disabled the cron (so if you want to run this you have to manually trigger this)   
```on:
  schedule:
    # Single trigger at 8:00 AM IST (2:30 AM UTC)
    #- cron: '30 0 1 * 1-5'  # Runs Mon-Fri at 8:00 AM IST
  workflow_dispatch:  # Manual trigger for both buy and sell
```

### Troubleshooting

- Double-check all secret names are exactly as shown above
- Ensure there are no trailing spaces in secret values
- For Google credentials, make sure to base64 encode the entire JSON file
